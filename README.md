<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Bidlify is my Semester Project 2 for the second year of my Front-End Development studies at Noroff. This project was designed to put into practice all the skills and knowledge acquired during the first year of the program.

The assignment was to build an auction house where users can add items for bidding. place bids on items, and earn credits by selling their items. Every registered user starts with 1,000 credits, which can be used to place bids on items. Additionally, users can increase their credits by successfully creating and selling items through the platform.
